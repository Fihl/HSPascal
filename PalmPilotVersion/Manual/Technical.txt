The file tAIB03e8.bin is required as it is mentioned in HSSys1. It gives the HSPascal icon. Otherwise change HSSys1.pas by removing or changing the $R line.

Unit HSSys1;

interface

{$R .\tAIB03e8.bin}

implementation

End.


You can override this one by using your own tAIB resource #1000 in your own source file. Also when not changing HSSys1.


Floating point:
Note that X:=2 * X is exactly the same as X:=2.0 * X; You do not need all those ".0" to speedup things.


The files inside Units/ (with two subdirectories) are included in the header files library HSPasLib.zip. 
As they gets compiled before the library lookup you:
o: can change them. Please send me your fixes
o: MUST remove old ones before installing on top of an old version.


The files Units/HSSys*.pas are the HSPascal System runtime. 

The files Units/UI/*.pas and Units/System/*.pas are Palm specific. 

When using the Library zip-file, you do not need to give {$SearchPath Units; Units\UI; Units\System}




Installation:

Unzip to a folder named whatever you like.
First REMOVE any old "Units" folder from this folder!!

Initial test: Run the CompAll.bat batch file, and verify you get some PRC files in your directory.

Start HSPascal.exe

Press File Open, chose a demo, and then F9 (to open and compile)

Find your compiled program in the same folder as the *.Pas source.
Maybe press F11 to see the generated code in assembler.

PS: Either use HSPasLib.zip or the Units folder. 
    HSPasLib.zip is one big file with all that is in Units.
    You can remove one or the other. 
    The Units folder is used before the HSPasLib.zip if the folder exists.
    When using the Library you need not to {$SearchPath Units; Units\UI; Units\System}




Known problems.

SaveAs does not update the TabControl before loading the file again.
