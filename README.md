# HSPascal
High Speed Pascal  

My compiler for the Palm Pilot in around year 2002  

The Atari and Amiga versions were coded in assembly, in 1990  
All of these were Motorola 68000 based  

Programmed in Delphi Pascal, like version 5 maybe  
Program is one IDE and also a commandline part for the actual compiler
